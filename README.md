Test

Failures:
Ruby isn't upgrading through sudo apt-get, through rvm, or through pip (which isn't installed).

I was also not able to upgrade python beyond 2.7 through these methods.

i suspect that a newer version of ruby will be needed to install homebrew with the method on the PyNE source for MacOS, I'm going to try the linux version next and see if that's better.
